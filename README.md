# Uncle Samsonite Game

I would like to first thank Jake Bowen, who created this character. This gmae is a Fan-Game of sorts which revolves around the myseterious character Uncle-Smasonite. The Uncle loves to dance and hates off brand soda.

If you want to learn more about this character you can view the first video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7iOauTsohU

This game is a stealth platformer, You must navigate one of the 2 levels which I made for it without being seen by the police bots

# Features
## Controls
### Normal Mode
- Arrow Key controls
- Up to Jump
- Down to enter shadow mode
- Shift to hide behind certain obstacles

### Shadow Mode
- Up to shadow jump (can double jump out of shadow)
- Down to emerge (doesn't make noise)
- Space to create a portal (press again to warp back to previous portal)

## Mechanics
- Guard Vision Cones can detect you while you are not in shadow mode (Sorry that they go through walls, couldn't figure this out)
- Light Kills you while in shadow mode
- Certain actions produce noise which will alert nearby guards and make them turn towards the source of the noise
- While in shadow mode, you can go through impossibly small gaps (This is the most obvious hint that I can given for the test level #1)
